**Getting Started:**

This repository requires PHP 8 or later to run.

**Understanding the Code:**

The code consists of the following files:

-   `Plan.php`: Defines the abstract `Plan` class with an abstract `getRate` method and a concrete `calculateBill` method.
-   `DomesticPlan.php`, `CommercialPlan.php`, `InstitutionalPlan.php`: Concrete subclasses of `Plan` implementing specific plan rates.
-   `GetPlanFactory.php`: Creates concrete plan objects based on the provided plan type.
-   `GenerateBill.php`: Demonstrates usage of the factory pattern to calculate electricity bills for different plan types.

**Running the Code:**

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open a terminal in the project directory.
3.  Run `php GenerateBill.php` to initiate the bill calculation process.
4.  Enter the desired plan type and number of units to calculate the bill amount.

**Learning Objectives:**

This project provides an opportunity to learn about:

-   The Factory Pattern and its benefits
-   Abstract classes and concrete subclasses in PHP
-   Applying design patterns to solve real-world problems

**Feel free to explore the code, modify it for different scenarios, and contribute your improvements!**
